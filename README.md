# EatDaBurger

Unfortunately the Heroku deployment didn't work. It kept asking for credit card information even though I've only deployed one other thing on there. I'll have to work on this more tomorrow. 

UPDATE -- Still working on Heroku upload, but I wound up recording the app in action as an alternative. The app is designed to be a burger eating app that lists the burgers you create as well as the burgers you create and eat. This project used express, handlebars, and mysql to be implemented.

When you run the app, it will give you a list of burgers created on the left side, with the burgers devoured on the right side, and a form in the middle where you can enter the type of burger you create. Creating a burger adds a new row to the table outlined in the SQL database, and it is given the value of the burger_name, as well as a default value of false for the devoured boolean, since you can't devour a burger that isn't made. 

Once the created burger shows up on the left side, it will give you the option to devour it. Should you click on this option, it will move the burger info over to the right side, which is the devoured column. 

A video showing the app in action can be viewed here:

Once I clear up the Heroku, I will get the link loaded and added here and the portfolio.
